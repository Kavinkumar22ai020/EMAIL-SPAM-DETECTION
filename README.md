# EMAIL-SPAM-DETECTION
Email spam causes many problems like wasting time and spreading unwanted messages. This project creates an Email Spam Detection System that checks emails and tells whether they are spam or not spam. 
The system reads the email text, removes unnecessary words, and uses machine learning to find patterns in spam emails. Based on these patterns, it classifies new emails correctly. This project helps to reduce spam and makes email usage safer and easier.
